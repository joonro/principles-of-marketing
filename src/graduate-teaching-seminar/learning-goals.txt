Learning Goals
#######################################


As you know, classes were cancelled on Friday and thus, the teaching
scholars seminar did not meet.  We will meet on September 28th as we would
have done anyway.  I will do my best to condense the session you missed and
the next session into one session. To help me do that, please be sure you
have sent your teaching philosophy statement and also, prior to Sept 28th,
please send me **learning goals for the class you teach (or if you don’t have
goals, send me objectives for a specific class session)**. Please send these
in a .doc or .docx.  If the idea of goals or objectives is completely new to
you, email me and I will be happy to provide more explanation.   We will
“workshop” both our teaching philosophies and we will discuss our teaching
goals at the next session.
