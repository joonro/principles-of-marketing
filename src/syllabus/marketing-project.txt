Guidelines Marketing Project
#######################################

SUMMARY
============

You will be assigned to a group of 5 students each. You and your team members will complete a
marketing plan for a new business of your choice, as if you are starting a small business together.
The marketing project is separated into two components: Mid-term report and the presentation.

* Mid-Report (10 Points): Report must be e-mailed to Professor Ro by 11:59PM on 11/5/2012
* Final Presentation (20 Points): 11/28, 12/3, and 12/5/2012 (20 minutes per group; 15min presentation, 5min Q&A)

Note: To prevent free riding, each member of the group will assess their team members’ contri-
butions to the project. Individuals can receive deductions if their team members indicate a lack of
contribution. Peer evaluation instructions will be provided to you toward the end of the semester.
You will turn in peer evaluations twice (for mid-report and ﬁnal presentation).

IMPORTANT TIPS
============

#. Apply the marketing knowledge you learned in class to your project. This will help you
develop a strong marketing plan, and will also give you a higher grade.
#. Stay focused: ONLY present directly relevant information in your papers and presentations.


CHOOSING A BUSINESS
========================

A few pointers to keep in mind when choosing a business (simply suggestions - not requirements
- for what have made good projects in the past):
* Something small. This will help you be more focused and make it easier for you to apply
marketing concepts in straightforward manner.
* Start with your own problem - is there a need that you have as a consumer that is not met
by any product in current market?


Mid-Term Report Paper
========================

* Format: Maximum 10 pages; double spaced; Arial font size 12; 1 inch margins)
* Use only the information that is directly relevant to your marketing plan.
* Business: Start by selecting a business, that is not in Austin.
     Identify a marketing idea – an unsatisﬁed consumer need (please see the above section
for pointers on choosing a business).
– Creative thinking is encouraged, but your plan must be realistic and executable. Respect
reasonable constraints (i.e. resources) and environmental forces (i.e. the economy).
– Once you discover a consumer need and a target market, describe what good(s) or
services(s) you plan to oﬀer to satisfy this need.
• Market Situation: Analyze your target market.
– Who are they? What are they like? What are their needs?
– Including the size and growth of the market.
• Environmental Forces: Describe the social, economic, technological, competitive, and reg-
ulatory trends that may help or hurt the performance of your business, both currently and
in the future. Apply concepts from your textbook chapter 3.
• Marketing Research Plan
– What are your research objectives; they need to be 1) concrete and 2) measurable
– How would you fulﬁll these objectives?
∗ Research methods
∗ Type of data
