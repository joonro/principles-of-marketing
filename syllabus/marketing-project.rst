==================================
 Guidelines for Marketing Project
==================================


Summary
=======

You will be assigned to a group of 5 students each. You and your team members
will complete a marketing plan for a new business of your choice, as if you
are starting a small business together. The marketing project is separated
into two components: Mid-term report and the presentation.

* Mid-Report (10 Points): Report must be e-mailed to Professor Ro by 11:59PM
  on 11/5/2012
* Final Presentation (20 Points): 11/28, 12/3, and 12/5/2012 (20 minutes per
  group; 15min presentation, 5min Q&A)

.. note::

    To prevent free riding, each member of the group will assess their team
    membersâ€™ contributions to the project. Individuals can receive deductions
    if their team members indicate a lack of contribution. Peer evaluation
    instructions will be provided to you toward the end of the semester. You
    will turn in peer evaluations twice (for mid-report and final
    presentation).

Important Tips
==============

#.  Apply the marketing knowledge you learned in class to your project. This
    will help you develop a strong marketing plan, and will also give you a
    higher grade.
#.  Stay focused: ONLY present directly relevant information in your papers
    and presentations.
#.  Be as specific as possible. For example, instead of saying the prices will
    differ across order sizes, give specific numbers (1: $10, 2: $18, etc)
#.  Provide an argument for your decisions. For example, if you are going to
    charge $20 for your service, also states WHY you think that price is
    reasonable or optimal.

Choosing a Business
===================

For your business, completely new good or service would be better, but at the
minimum, it has to be *something currently not served in Austin*.

A few pointers to keep in mind when choosing a business (simply suggestions -
not requirements - for what have made good projects in the past):

* Something small. This will help you be more focused and make it easier for
  you to apply marketing concepts in straightforward manner.
* Start with your own problem - is there a need that you have as a consumer
  that is not met by any product in current market?

Mid-Term Report Paper
=====================

   * Include title and table of contents (generated with styles) pages. These
     pages will not be part of 10 page limit

Contents

Business
~~~~~~~~

* Start by selecting a business.

* Identify a marketing idea - an unsatisfied consumer need (please see the
  above section for pointers on choosing a business).
* Creative thinking is encouraged, but your plan must be realistic and
  executable. Respect reasonable constraints (i.e. resources) and
  environmental forces (i.e. the economy).
* Once you discover a consumer need and a target market, describe what good(s)
  or services(s) you plan to offer to satisfy this need.

Market Situation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Analyze your target market.
* Who are they? What are they like? What are their needs?
* Including the size and growth of the market.
* Environmental Forces: describe any of the social, economic, technological,
  competitive, and regulatory trends that may be pertinent to the performance
  of your business, both currently and in the future. Apply concepts from your
  textbook chapter 3.
* Include SWOT analysis

Marketing Research Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* What are your research objectives; they need to be 1) concrete and 2)
  measurable

* How would you fulfill these objectives?

    * Research methods
    * Type of data

  presenters, or each members of your group taking turns - all fine

  depends on how convincingly you argue that your product will be successful
  in the market
